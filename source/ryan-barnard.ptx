  <introduction>
    <p>I am a computer science student and member of the swim team at The College of Idaho</p>
  </introduction>
  <p>I am from Pendleton, OR, a small town in eastern Oregon. I grew up playing many sports but swimming
  ended up being the one that I enjoyed the most.</p>
  <p>I initally came to The College of Idaho with the intention to study math-physics and eventually go to graduate school
  for mechanical engineering, but I ended up really enjoying a computer science class that I had to take and now I am a computer
  science major.</p>
